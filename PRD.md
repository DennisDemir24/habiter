## Project Overview Explanation
Your application is a comprehensive habit tracking and journaling mobile app built with React Native and Expo. It helps users build better habits and maintain a personal journal of their progress and thoughts. 
The key aspects of the app include:

Habit Tracking:
Core Functionality:
Users can create, view, edit, and mark habits as completed. For example, habits may involve activities like reading, exercising, or any daily task.

Visual Representation:
Each habit is displayed with an icon, color coding, and basic details like the title and description. This visual cue helps in quickly assessing the progress.

Journaling:

Expressive Tool:
In addition to habit tracking, the app provides a journaling feature where users can record their thoughts, moods, and reflections.

Interaction:
Users can create new journal entries, and then later view, edit, or delete those entries. The mood selection is also included to help gauge emotional trends over time.
